I'm a Software Developer from Nepal, currently based in New Jersey. I play with Ruby, Rails, AWS, Chef, Docker, and other cool technologies in my day-to-day life. I write here if I face any interesting stuffs in my job or life. If it's non-technical, I write on [life](/life).

Besides technology, I'm passionate about music, places, and books. Please expect some posts in Nepali.
